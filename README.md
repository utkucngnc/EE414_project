#Low-Dropout (LDO) Voltage Regulator Design Project


[TL;DR]  In this project, a low dropout voltage regulator is designed according to the requirements given. As band-gap voltage reference circuitry, a PTAT (Proportional-to-Absolute Temperature) generator with a temperature compensation stage at the end is adopted. As error amplifier, a telescopic amplifier topology is adopted. Whole design is simulated via Cadence.
